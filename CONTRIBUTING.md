# How to contribute to slim_bridge?

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/blackcoffeerobotics/slim_bridge/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/blackcoffeerobotics/slim_bridge/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of slim_bridge will be *declined*.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change and create a new issue, then start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you want to contribute to the slim_bridge documentation?**

* You can contribute to the documentation by making it more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest version.
